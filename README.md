## ⛄ Projects ⛄
**Highlighted**

- [Price Tracker](https://github.com/aobutakuki/NoPrecinho)
WIP - This project is a price comparison/tracker tool that will store the values of certain items in local supermarkets onto a database, the java code then will use thymeleaf and build a front end with an easy display, allowing anyone to compare prices and find the best deals locally

- [Facilitando Acupuntura Store](https://github.com/aobutakuki/facilitando_acupuntura_loja)
WIP - This is an on-going project, out of the ones in here it can be considered my first professional project as I need to work with the client and understand their requests, while maintaing a good code (with a few restrictions here and there) so that it can be implemented without breaking the backend. (Will be published soon)

## 🎱 Hobbies 🎱
**📚 Reading 📚**

My passion for reading ignited while learning Japanese through literary immersion. Since then, I have consistently read over 60 books per year, with a personal best of 105 in 2023. I am particularly drawn to the intricate plots of mystery and crime, as well as character-driven romance novels.


**🎮 Gaming 🎮**

My gaming journey began with a Nintendo Wii and has evolved to a passion for diverse genres, from immersive AAA titles like Cyberpunk 2077 to strategic indie games like Brotato and Hades. I credit gaming as the catalyst for my interest in programming, and I am driven by the long-term goal of channeling my technical skills into game development.


**🖥 Technology 🖥**

My enduring interest in technology drives my ambition to be part of its innovation. I am currently building a broad foundation by exploring several advanced fields, including reverse engineering, cryptography, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing. To this end, I am systematically learning the most effective programming languages for each specialization while also studying the fundamentals of hardware—both how individual components like CPUs and GPUs function and how they integrate to form a complete system.

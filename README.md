## Welcome to my profile

I am a Software Engineering student and I am currently mainly learning C++ and Java. 
I thought it would be nice to track my journey as I learn and will upload projects as I create them in order to build a small portifolio.


### Projects â›„
**C++**
I've only recently picked up C++, however it is been a fun journey and here is what I've done so far:

- Random Number Guessing Game
  
- QT Ebup Reader

- QT Book Tracker




Note:
Since I am still learning the code is likely not perfectly organized and might not be optimized to it's full potential. The code might also have severe limitations which I am learning how to handle and improving as time goes on.

## 🍪 Welcome to my profile 🍪

I am a Software Engineering student and I am currently mainly learning C++ and Java. 
I thought it would be nice to track my journey as I learn and will upload projects as I create them in order to build a small portifolio.

## 📌 Skills 📌

📗 **C++**
📗**CSS**
🛠**QT** (C++ Version)
🗂**SQL**


## ⛄ Projects ⛄
**C++**
I've only recently picked up C++, however it is been a fun journey and here is what I've done so far:

- [Random Number Guessing Game](https://github.com/aobutakuki/Random-Number-Guessing-Game)
  
- [QT Ebup Reader](https://github.com/aobutakuki/QT-Book-Reader)

- [QT Book Tracker](https://github.com/aobutakuki/QT-Book-Tracker)


## 📖 Languages 📖
🇧🇷 Portuguese (Native)
🇬🇧 English (Fluent)
🇯🇵 Japanese (Fluent)


## 🎱 Hobbies 🎱
**📚 Reading 📚**
I started reading when I was learning Japanese through immersion during the pandemic and I've read at least 60 books per year ever since, with the highest being 2023 with 105 books!
Maybe that is the reason a lot of my projects end up being related to this topic...

**🎮 Gaming 🎮**
I've been gaming since I was a child starting on the nintendo wii, playing mario and party games to modern day counter-strike and valorant. I play almost any genre from AAA titles like Cyberpunk to 2D rogue-like/strategy games like Brotato and Hades. I believe gaming played a crucial role in getting me into programming and I want to develop my own 2D game later on my programming journey. I also plan on getting into mod development and countribute to open-source game projects as I gain experience to do so.

**🖥 Technology 🖥**
Ever since I was little I was always attracted to technology so taking part in developing it makes me happy. I want to explore diverse fields before deciding on what I want to specialize, some fields I find attractive are: reverse engineering, crypto, artificial intelligence and quantum computing. I plan on studying the mentioned topics and also learning at least the basic for the "most suited" languages for each one of them (ex:. in the case of AI that would likely be python, etc). I also want to learn the basics of how hardware components work, individually (as in per say a GPU, or CPU) and collectively (how they communicate with each other).

Note:
Since I am still learning the code is likely not perfectly organized and might not be optimized to it's full potential. The code might also have severe limitations which I am learning how to handle and improving as time goes on.

I enjoy self-learning but I also loving working as a team. I believe getting your hands dirty is the best way to learn, and that actually doing something is a much better experience then just reading/watching lectures.
